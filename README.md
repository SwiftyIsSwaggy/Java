## About Repository
This is the repository which I will keep up to date with my Java work projects done for me and me friends. Feel free to read, understand and try to implement the code.
It may be quite difficult to understand but for more questions, contact me through WhatsApp, WeChat or email :swiftyxswaggy@outlook.com

## Disclaimer
These projects are based on my personal research and school assignments as well as requirements.
Do not share without owner's permission. There is a reason the repository is set to private and only those who were given authority to copy can do so. Thank You. Stay swift, P.
